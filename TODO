SX likely has a possible initialization bug where some memory descriptors are
getting garbage output_index values for primitive_at... and this triggers an
assertion in input_memory about memory being always associated with
"index 0".

For now I've added a slew of debug, that looks great on Intel, but shows
garbage on SX.  (also should check reinterpret_cast and static_cast stuff
for correctness?)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intel compilation without USE_CBLAS should NOT include the im2col-gemm version.
(Yes, I want things to be slow, to detect which
	mkldnn::impl::memory_desc_wrapper::off_v(int const*, bool) const
 templates should be inlined, because a huge amount of time is spent
 inside the function calls to calculate offsets.)
